In addition, please submit a 1 page summary.txt file â€“ this should contain the name and description of
your project (4-5 sentences), describe which of the categories you used from the above, and the actual
work breakdown (who did what).
As a reminder, please keep your TA (the one who sent you feedback) in the loop on any changes. They
should also be the first point of contact if you have any questions.
If you made any changes to your project after your proposal or since you last spoke with your TA, please
mention the changes and the reasons for making them

The number of steps it would take to get from the user page to the Philosophy page along the quickest and most efficient path (BFS)
Graph and Graph Algorithms, Information Networds
We will be using Graph/Graph Algorithms to find the routes from one page to the other (most likely BFS or modified Dijkstra's, but an altered version where we check to make sure there are no loops). We will be using web-scraping to analyze the Wikipedia pages similar to HW3. 
Equal parts divided into back end research and development including web crawling, pattern finding, and implementation.
There may be an element added if front end is also involved.
