Wikipedia WebCrawl is a terminal-based game inspired by the Kevin Bacon Degree Simulator.
With this game, you enter a start and end topic on Wikipedia. Then, we use a BFS method to
calculate the first shortest-length path between those two topics, using pages as nodes and
edges as links between pages. This works by navigating to the starting article and webscraping
all of the page links featured within its body. Then, via BFS, each link is searched to see
if they are the end topic, or if one of their webscraped links contains the end topic. Once
the end article is found, its length and linkage to the starting article is returned. This was 
an Implementation Project focused on the categories: Graph and Graph Algorithms, and Information Networks. 

We divided the work as follows:
Jill: Set up base files, BFS structure, and link webscraper
Mia: Set up input and output and summary.txt
Lisa: Set up BFS modification, list of links in shortest path

We originally planned on making a front-end, but after discussing with our TA, decided not to.
